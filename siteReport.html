            <h1> How did I find the module?</h1>
            <p> In my opinion web development has been a very exciting module with many opportunities to improve my
                creativity and also problem solving skills. However, there have been some frustrating moments, for
                example
                when my code wasn't working and I couldn't figure out why, but that only made me strive to improve and
                by the end
                of the day I would learn something new, which I found to be inspiring. HTML and CSS were both incredibly
                enjoyable languages as I found them to be quite fun to interact with. I really liked the
                simplicity of HTML and CSS; while they seemed confusing at first, they were much easier to
                grasp compared to other languages I've been in contact with, such as Python for example.</p>
            <h1> Design decisions</h1>
            <p> My main inspiration came from the grid layout we practiced during our lectures at the university.
                However, I went for a slightly different approach because I just thought it's going to look more
                organised if I go for a simple grid layout design where everything is placed into one column, which
                means I have only one semantic field per row. The main purpose of this layout was to enhance user
                experience as I believe that the simplicity of this design will ensure easier navigation through the
                pages.</p>

            <h1> Validation screenshots</h1>
            <p> Below are all validation screenshots for each HTML and CSS file used in the assignment. As you can see,
                all the files are valid and contain no errors.</p>
            <h1> Video demo</h1>
            <p> Below is the URL link to the video demo just in case it's not accessible for some reason through the
                Video Demo webpage:</p>
